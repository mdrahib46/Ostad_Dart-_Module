Define an abstract class Account with the following properties:
● accountNumber (integer)
● balance (double)
It should also have the following methods:
● deposit(double amount): Adds the specified amount to the account balance.

● withdraw(double amount): Abstract method that deducts the specified amount from
the account balance.


Define a class SavingsAccount that extends the Account class. It should have an additional
property called interestRate (double).
Implement the withdraw() method in the SavingsAccount class as follows:
● Subtract the specified amount from the account balance.
● Apply the interest rate to the remaining balance.


Define a class CurrentAccount that extends the Account class. It should have an
additional property called overdraftLimit (double).
Implement the withdraw() method in the CurrentAccount class as follows:
● Allow withdrawals up to the overdraft limit.
● If the withdrawal amount exceeds the overdraft limit, print a message indicating
insufficient funds.


In main()
● Create an instance of the SavingsAccount class by providing values for the account
number, initial balance, and interest rate.
● Use the instance to perform operations like depositing and withdrawing money.
● Create an instance of the CurrentAccount class by providing values for the account
number, initial balance, and overdraft limit.
● Use the instance to perform operations like depositing and withdrawing.










There is a base class called Media and it has a method called play() that prints
“Playing media...”.

You need to create a derived class called Song that inherits from the Media class and adds
an additional attribute called artist (string). The Song class should override the play()
method to print the artist name along with the media play message like
“Playing song by $artist...'”.
In main() create one instance of Media and one of Song. Call their play() methods that print proper messages.
